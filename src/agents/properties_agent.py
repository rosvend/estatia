"""`properties_node` — the LangGraph node that finds candidate properties.

This is the orchestration layer over the two-stage scraper in
:mod:`src.tools.scraper`. It reads the structured user brief from the shared
state, splits the constraints into two buckets, and runs a discover → enrich →
filter pipeline:

1. **URL-pushable constraints** (``location``, ``property_type``,
   ``transaction_type``, ``price``, ``bedrooms``) are handed to
   :func:`search_listings`, which bakes them straight into the portal search
   URLs — cheap, no per-property cost.
2. **In-memory constraints** (``bathrooms``, ``parking_lots``, ``estrato``,
   ``area_m2``) can't be expressed in every portal URL reliably, so they are
   enforced *after* the deep scrape, against the fully parsed ``Listing``.

The node deep-scrapes at most 5 discovered URLs — drawn evenly from every
portal and fetched concurrently — to keep latency bounded, then returns the
survivors under ``raw_listings``, the state key the downstream
``whatsapp_agent`` consumes. Finca Raíz and Metro Cuadrado are equally
important sources of truth, so neither discovery nor enrichment lets one
portal crowd the other out.

Requirements live in the state as a flat ``list[Constraint]`` keyed by a
snake_case English ``field`` name that mirrors the :class:`Listing` model.

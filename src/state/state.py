LangGraph idiom: `TypedDict` with `total=False` so each node returns only
the keys it wrote; missing keys are simply absent and the framework merges
partial updates. `Annotated[list, add]` is applied where the field must
*accumulate across iterations* of a loop, not be overwritten — see the note
on `chat_history` and `softening_history` below.
